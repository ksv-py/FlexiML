## üîß Features

* üìÇ **Data Ingestion**: Upload CSV or other data formats
* üßπ **Preprocessing Options**: Custom or automated imputers, encoding, scaling
* üß† **Model Training**:

  * Choose your own model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
  * Or let FlexiML select and tune the best model for your data
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Custom/Auto Hyperparameter Tuning**
* üì¶ **Downloadable Preprocessor & Model Files**
* üîå **Integrate your trained pipeline via API (future)**
* üìà **Analytics & Model Evaluation**
* üß† **Auto-retraining (planned)**
* ‚òÅÔ∏è **SaaS-ready Architecture (planned)**
